# RBAC UI - Role-Based Access Control

## Project Overview

RBAC UI is a web application that implements **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**, allowing **administrators** to manage user access to various parts of the application. With this system, roles can be assigned to users, ensuring secure and controlled access to resources.

### Key Features:
- **üîê Role Management**: Admins can create, update, and delete roles, managing access rights efficiently.
- **üë• User Management**: Admin users can add, update, or delete users and assign them specific roles.
- **üõ°Ô∏è Access Control**: Control which parts of the application users can view or modify based on their roles.
- **üîë Authentication**: Secure login ensures that only authorized users have access to the app.
- **üì± Responsive UI**: Built with **React.js**, offering a modern, user-friendly, and responsive interface across devices.

This RBAC system ensures **scalability**, **security**, and **easy management** of users and roles, making it ideal for applications of all sizes.
